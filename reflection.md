What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked unit testing, it was very interesting and I can see its wide uses for ensuring that code runs as wanted. I think it's very convinent to be able to run just a part of the code in many different segments instead of just changing the main everytime. I would tell people to read through the code fully before trying anything and to leave time to do the assignment.
